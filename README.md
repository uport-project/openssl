# iOS OpenSSL Framework for uPort SDK

This is a stripped down version of OpenSSL that builds as an iOS framework. It is part of the [**uPort** SDK](https://github.com/uport-project/uport-ios-sdk) and will be built by [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

This repository was extracted from [CoreEthereum](https://github.com/wjmelements/CoreEthereum). The second part of the original CoreEthereum repository is now [uport-ios-core-eth](https://github.com/uport-project/uport-ios-core-eth), which imports this OpenSSL framework.

## Updating

OpenSSL verions 1.0.1e is used currently. The original CoreEthereum repository has update scripts. Since these scripts need to be fixed/ported to work with this repository, they are not included here yet.

## License

This repository comes with the same [licence](LICENSE.txt) as the original [OpenSSL repository](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).
